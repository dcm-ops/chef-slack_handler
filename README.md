## Chef Slack Handler has moved here : [rackspace-cookbooks/chef-slack_handler](github.com/rackspace-cookbooks/chef-slack_handler)

We've not had time to maintain this outside of internal use. In the interest of community, we're turning this initial work over to the rackspace folks.

Description
===========

A cookbook for a `chef_handler` that sends reports and exceptions to Slack using an integration webhook.
